>  This *work*book goes with a *text*book. You should have

>  chat room. When you accept the invite GitHub Classrooms will
>  create your personal, private workbook by copying the workbook
>  starter repo.
> 
>  For questions about anything in the course including your projects
>  and assignments you can create an issue on your workbook and your
>  instructor will see it. You can also ask in the course chat.
> 
>  If you catch spelling issues or other errors with either this 
>  starter workbook or the textbook (click title) please open
>  issues on them suggesting corrections.
